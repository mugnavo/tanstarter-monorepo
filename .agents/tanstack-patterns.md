# TanStack Patterns

## Route Group Conventions

- Protected routes live under `apps/web/src/routes/_auth/**`, enforced by `beforeLoad` in the `_auth` layout (`apps/web/src/routes/_auth/route.tsx`).
- Guest-only routes live under `apps/web/src/routes/_guest/**`, enforced by `beforeLoad` in the `_guest` layout (`apps/web/src/routes/_guest/route.tsx`).
- Auth-specific route guard behavior and middleware rules are documented in `.agents/auth.md`.

## Data Fetching

TanStack Query is the client cache and source of truth for server-owned or server-derived data. Router owns params, search state, redirects, and other route decisions.

- Define reusable `queryOptions` factories. The `queryFn` should call a Start server function and forward its `signal`.
- Use the same options with loaders, `beforeLoad`, `useQuery`/`useSuspenseQuery`, and cache updates.
- Do not return query data from a loader for components to read with `useLoaderData`; warm the Query cache, then subscribe to it in the component.
- Loaders and `beforeLoad` may return URL-derived or routing-only values; do not use them as a second cache for server data.

Route loaders are isomorphic; they run on both server and client. Keep database, filesystem, secrets, and other server-only access behind a server function.

```typescript
export const todosQueryOptions = () =>
  queryOptions({
    queryKey: ["todos"],
    queryFn: ({ signal }) => $getTodos({ signal }),
  });

// Route loader
loader: ({ context }) => context.queryClient.query(todosQueryOptions());

// Route component
const { data: todos } = useSuspenseQuery(todosQueryOptions());
```

Use `beforeLoad` only when query data affects routing, such as an auth redirect. Follow `apps/web/src/routes/_auth/route.tsx`; route guards should read `authQueryOptions()` through `context.queryClient` rather than copy user data into router context.

### Freshness and Navigation

`queryClient.query` uses `staleTime` to decide whether to fetch:

- Missing cache: fetch and wait.
- Fresh cache: return it immediately.
- Stale cache: fetch and wait.
- `staleTime: "static"`: return any cached data immediately, even when stale. Fetch and wait only when the cache is empty.

Most route loaders can safely use stale cached data to avoid blocking navigation, so prefer returning cached data first. Read with `staleTime: "static"`, then revalidate using the query's normal/default `staleTime`:

```typescript
// in a route loader/beforeLoad
const todos = await context.queryClient.query({
  ...todosQueryOptions(),
  staleTime: "static",
});
void context.queryClient.query(todosQueryOptions());
// ^ similar to the deprecated ensureQueryData({ revalidateIfStale: true }) behavior
```

The static read unblocks navigation with cached data. The unawaited call refreshes it in the background when stale.

Use `query` without awaiting it to prefetch non-critical data. Await `query` when data is required before rendering or making a route decision.

```typescript
import { noop } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// prefetch in a route loader/beforeLoad
void context.queryClient.query(todosQueryOptions()).catch(noop);
```

Never use cached route data as a security decision. Fresh authorization and destructive-operation checks belong in the server function or its middleware.

## Mutations

Use TanStack Query's `useMutation` with Start server functions. Prefer a single-round-trip mutation: return the canonical affected data, then write it to every exact cache that can be updated safely. Do not issue a follow-up read by default.

```typescript
const updateTodo = useMutation({
  mutationFn: $updateTodo,
  onSuccess: (updated) => {
    queryClient.setQueryData(todoQueryOptions(updated.id).queryKey, updated);
    queryClient.setQueryData(todosQueryOptions().queryKey, (current) =>
      current?.map((todo) => (todo.id === updated.id ? updated : todo)),
    );
  },
});
```

- Update caches immutably from the server result, not from assumptions about what the server stored.
- Invalidate only affected caches that cannot be reconstructed safely, such as aggregates, permission-dependent data, or lists whose membership/order may change.
- Avoid broad invalidation and automatic refetch-after-every-write.
- Use `router.invalidate()` only when route guards, redirects, or other route logic must rerun. It is not the default way to refresh query-backed data.

### True Optimistic Updates

An `onSuccess` cache write is response-driven, not optimistic. Use a true `onMutate` update only when the action is reversible, the cache transformation is predictable, and latency materially affects the interaction.

In `onMutate`, cancel matching queries, snapshot previous data, and update the cache. Roll back in `onError`, then reconcile with the server result or targeted invalidation.

Do not optimistically apply destructive or security-sensitive mutations, server-generated identities, or complex multi-entity side effects. Wait for server confirmation, then update or remove cached data.

## Auth and Security Boundaries

- `_auth` `beforeLoad` caching improves navigation UX; treat every protected server function as an independently callable API endpoint.
- Use `authMiddleware` from `packages/auth/src/tanstack/middleware.ts` when cached session state is acceptable; use `freshAuthMiddleware` for destructive or security-sensitive mutations.
- Always perform authorization and resource-access checks on the server.
- See `.agents/auth.md` for additional auth middleware, route guard, and session/cookie conventions.

## Server Boundaries

- Import `createServerFn` wrappers statically anywhere; never dynamically import them. Prefix their names with `$` (for example, `$getUser`).
- Guard server-only logic with a handler, `createServerOnlyFn`, `*.server.*`, or `import "@tanstack/react-start/server-only";`. Module-scope imports are fine behind these boundaries; never run server-only logic in isomorphic module scope.
